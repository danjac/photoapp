<h2>About PhotoLocker</h2>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#why">Why make yet another photo-sharing site?</a></li>
</ul>

<p id="why">
    PhotoLocker is not a photo-sharing site. Unlike Facebook, Imgur and other sites, the point of PhotoLocker is to be a safe and convenient place to keep your photos
    privately. You can still share your photos with friends and family, but not the entire world.
